## Project description :

We will be creating a recipe website where an user can create an account. 
They will be able to add their own recipes to their "cookbook" and pictures.
They will also be able to save recipes from other users on the site to their "cookbook".

## Colour Scheme (suggestion):

I think we could use these colours for the website based off of arriva denmark
- 004d73 - a dark blue
- 00334e - a navy blue 
- 007fbd - a royal blue (currently using for buttons)
- dbebfa - a sky blue (currently the background color for all the pages)
Other colours that can be used
- 848a8c - a grey

## Tasks :
I've brainstromed some basic pages that we can inculded in our webiste feel free to update and add to this
I've started out the html files, and currently looking at furthering the home page and the recipe page atm
for the CSS part i think that needs to be in a separate file not to sure how to do that rn, but if you guys understand please and to the readme and update!

we can also make branches to work on different parts, but for now i dont think we need to 
I hope you guys are okay with this so far! -Simone
